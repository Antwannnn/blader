## Q&A

### What is blader ?

Blader is a typing speed test website. Its goal is to measure precisely your speed when it comes to typing on your keyboard.

### Is blader different from monkeytype ?

In many aspects, blader could be easily considered as a "monkeytype clone" and it would actually be a massive compliment considering
the insane work that was and is still being made on monkeytype. When playing on blader, you'll easily remark that monkeytype has been
an inspiration on many fields including UI, UX, global esthetics, systems and many others. Nevertheless, blader has never been imagined
to be a monkeytype concurrent, in fact, the team developing monkeytype is composed of professional developers and the website has been released
a long time ago which makes it the undisputed best typing speed test out there.

### Who is developing blader ?

I'm Antoine, a passionate french computer science student. I'm the only person developing on blader. I started this project a year and a half ago
while the initial goal was to train myself on new web technologies. This is the reason why this project was developed in NextJS. I learned by doing and this is the reason why if you look at the source code, there might be some code that is not consistent with current React / NextJS standards.

### Can I contribute to the source code ?

Of course, Blader is probably the most accomplished web development project I‚Äôve ever made, and I‚Äôd be glad to see people contribute to make it even better. However, keep in mind that I'm a complete beginner in open-source project management.

### What is the stack used for blader ?

The current stack is composed of NextJS for frontend & backend, MongoDB for non relational database. In the future Cloudflare for image storing (especially profile pictures) and also Cloudflare for the VPS hosting the website itself.

### Is the project deployed ?

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt currently have the necessary funds to pay for servers (Cloudflare, VPS, MongoDB clusters, etc.). But as soon as my financial priorities change, I plan to fully deploy the project.
