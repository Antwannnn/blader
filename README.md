## What is blader ?

Blader is a typing speed test website. Its goal is to measure precisely your speed when it comes to typing on your keyboard.

## Is blader different from monkeytype ?

In many aspects, blader could be easily considered as a "monkeytype clone" and it would actually be a massive compliment considering
the insane work that was and is still being made on monkeytype. When playing on blader, you'll easily remark that monkeytype has been
an inspiration on many fields including UI, UX, global esthetics, systems and many others. Nevertheless, blader has never been imagined
to be a monkeytype concurrent, in fact, the team developing monkeytype is composed of professional developers and the website has been released
a long time ago which makes it the undisputed best typing speed test out there.
